# Project "Stellar Burgers"
https://annabreamer.github.io/stellar-burgers/
## Overview
Stellar Burgers is a cosmic burger app built with React and Redux that allows users to customize their orders. I implemented client-side routing with React Router, integrated a global Redux store for state management, and set up authentication to secure user profiles. The application features dynamic modals for ingredient details and order information, ensuring a seamless user experience. I also added comprehensive testing with Cypress for integration tests and Jest for unit tests to ensure robust functionality.

## Technologies Used
**HTML5, CSS3** (responsive design)**, JavaScript** (React, Redux, React Router)**, Jest, Cypress, Git, Figma**
